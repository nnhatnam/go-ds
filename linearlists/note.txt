A linear list is a sequence of n >= 0 nodes X[1], X[2] ..., X[n] whose essential structural properties involve only
the relative positions between items as they appear in a line. The only things we care about in such structures
are the facts that, if jn > 0, X[1] is the first node and X[n] is the last; and if 1 < k < n, the kth node X[k] is
preceded by X[k-1] and followed by X[k+1]

OPERATIONS we might want to perform on this linear lists library:

1. Gain access to the kth node of the list to examine and/or to change the contents of its fields (IMPORTANT)
2. Insert a new node just before or after the kth node (IMPORTANT)
3. Delete the kth node. (IMPORTANT)
4. Combine two or more linear lists into a single list
5. Split a linear list into two or more lists
6. Make a copy of a linear list
7. Determine the number of nodes in a list
8. Sort the nodes of the list into ascending order based on certain fields of the nodes
9. Search the list for the occurrence of a node with a particular value in some fields.
